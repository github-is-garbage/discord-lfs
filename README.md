# DiscordLFS

Not an original idea. I saw [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOuephDbkJQ) video and wanted to recreate it for myself :]

## Features

- Runs off slash commands
- Encodes messages for easy downloading, only main message link is required to download
- Slower than hell because I'm bad at python

## Setup

1. Create a `.env` file in the `src` folder
2. Add the line `BOT_TOKEN=(your bot token here)` to the `.env`
3. Add the line `GUILD_ID=(your guild ID here)` to the `.env`
4. `python3 main.py`
5. Profit (Use the bot's slash commands)
